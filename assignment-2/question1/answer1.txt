HTTP methods are fundamental components of the HTTP protocol used in client-server communication within web architectures. They define the action that the client (typically a web browser or application) wants the server to perform on a specific resource. Each HTTP method has a distinct role and is used in different scenarios depending on the desired outcome.

Here's a summary of the most commonly used HTTP methods:

1. GET
Purpose: Retrieve data from a server.
Usage: When a client wants to request data from a specific resource, like a web page or an API endpoint.
Example: Retrieving a list of products from an online store.


2. POST
Purpose: Send data to the server to create a new resource.
Usage: When a client wants to submit form data, upload a file, or send information to an API.
Example: Creating a new user account or posting a comment on a blog.


3. PUT
Purpose: Update an existing resource or create it if it doesn't exist.
Usage: When a client wants to modify a resource, like updating user details or replacing a file.
Example: Updating a user's profile information.


4. DELETE
Purpose: Remove a resource from the server.
Usage: When a client wants to delete a resource, like removing a user account or deleting a post.
Example: Deleting a product from an inventory.


5. PATCH
Purpose: Partially update an existing resource.
Usage: When a client wants to make a partial update, like changing only the user's email address.
Example: Updating the status of an order.


6. HEAD
Purpose: Retrieve only the headers of a resource without the body.
Usage: When a client wants to check if a resource exists or to obtain metadata without downloading the full content.
Example: Checking if a file exists on the server before downloading it.


7. OPTIONS
Purpose: Describe the communication options available for the target resource.
Usage: Often used in CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to determine what HTTP methods are supported by the server.
Example: Pre-flight request in CORS to check allowed methods.


8. CONNECT
Purpose: Establish a tunnel to the server, usually used for SSL encryption.
Usage: When a client needs to establish a secure connection to the server, often for HTTPS.
Example: Setting up a secure connection to a website.


9. TRACE
Purpose: Perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
Usage: Mainly used for debugging to see how the message is being processed by the server.
Example: Tracing the path of a request through multiple proxies.
