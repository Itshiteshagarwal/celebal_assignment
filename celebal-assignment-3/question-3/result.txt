1. HTTP Headers:

HTTP headers are metadata sent along with HTTP requests or responses between the client and server. They provide essential information about the request or response, such as content type, caching policies, authentication, etc.

There are two types of HTTP headers:

Request Headers: Sent by the client to the server, providing information like the type of content being requested or about the client itself (browser, user-agent, etc.).
Response Headers: Sent by the server back to the client, giving information about the server or the requested content (e.g., status code, content type).

Common headers:
Content-Type: Specifies the media type (e.g., application/json, text/html).
Authorization: Used for authentication information.
Cache-Control: Controls how caching is handled.
User-Agent: Information about the client (browser, app).
Set-Cookie: Used for managing sessions and storing cookies.
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Used in CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
Example:

2. HTTP Status Codes:
These are standard response codes that indicate the status of the HTTP request. Status codes are divided into five categories:

1xx (Informational): The request has been received and the process is continuing.
100 Continue
101 Switching Protocols


2xx (Success): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
200 OK: Standard success response.
201 Created: Resource successfully created (e.g., POST request).
204 No Content: No content to send but the request was successful.

3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.
301 Moved Permanently: The resource has moved to a new URL.
302 Found: Temporarily moved to another URL.
304 Not Modified: Cached version can be used.

4xx (Client Error): The client made an error.
400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request.
401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required.
403 Forbidden: The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.
404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found.

5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill a valid request.
500 Internal Server Error: General server error.
502 Bad Gateway: Server acting as a gateway received an invalid response.
503 Service Unavailable: Server cannot handle the request due to overload or maintenance.
